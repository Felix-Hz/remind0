# Remind0

- Telegram bot to write expenses to a sqlite db.  
- Useful if you're used to sending yourself all kinds of notes through some messaging app anyway.
- Just hook up some UI to read all the expenses you send to yourself and plot some piecharts or whatnot.
- Thought as a small project to be hosted on a Rasperry Pi.

Will prolly improve these docs and provide some setup notes, but not today.
